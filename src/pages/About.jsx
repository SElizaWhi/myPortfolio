          Hello, I'm Sophie, a 27-year-old web developer based in NÃ®mes, raised in the sunny 
          south of France but born in Surrey (UK).
          <br />I am passionate about web development and am a full-stack
          developer, but my ultimate goal is to specialize in front-end
          development. I believe that user experience is critical in any web
          project, and I am always up for a challenge to overcome blockers and
          find innovative solutions.
          <br />
          In my free time, I love to cook and explore different cuisines, as
          well as play video games and learn about new cultures.
          <br />
          Thank you for visiting my site, and I look forward to connecting with
          you.
